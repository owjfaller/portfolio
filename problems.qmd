<h1>Problems Owen is Exploring</h1>

:::

This page highlights the problems and opportunities Owen is currently researching and thinking about.

## Text To Speech

I don't like how it can be difficult to find interactive text to speech. I want to build an application that lets you turn text to speech in an interactive way-using AI voices of whoever you want.

## One Time iPhone Notifications

I want to make it so you can schedule from the calendar app to have alarms on your phone.

## Public Speaking Coach

I want to build an AI app that analyzes your speech and teaches you to be a better public speaker.

## AI Stock Insider Trader Tracker

I want to build a website that analyzes stock purchases and sales of senators to find patterns of who may be insider trading.

## A Workout Plan Music App

An app that interrupts your music to tell you when it is time to do your next set at the gym.
